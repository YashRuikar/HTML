                <h2 id="2008-12">The greatest teams of all time: Barcelona 2008–12</h2>
    
                <p><b>The Greatest: </b>With Lionel Messi at his absolute peak, Josep Guardiola's FC Barcelona perfected an overwhelming form of total football in a fearsome four-year spell. When FC Barcelona were at their 'tiki-taka' pinnacle under Josep Guardiola, opponents could not get the ball off them, let alone score. UEFA.com dissects one of the teams that changed football</p>
    
                <p><b>The golden age</b><br> Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona won the 2005/06 UEFA Champions League, but one-time midfielder Guardiola's promotion from B-team dugout to senior coaching job may have been what turned a brilliant side into a legendary one. In his four years in charge, Guardiola's men won 14 of the 19 competitions they entered, including six trophies in his first term, 2008/09: the Spanish Super Cup, Liga and Copa del Rey, plus the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
    
                <p>If the haul was mighty, perhaps more significant was that Guardiola handed debuts to 22 players who – like himself – had come through the Barcelona academy. The team helped make Xavi Hernández, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi into household names, and when they <b>beat Manchester United FC 3-1 at Wembley</b> in the 2010/11 <b>UEFA Champions League</b> final, Sir Alex Ferguson could only praise them: "They are the best team we've faced in my time as a manager. No one has given us a hiding like that. It's a great moment for them. They deserve it because they play the right way and enjoy their football.</p>

                <p>In 2008, Josep Guardiola accepted the difficult job of replacing Frank Rijkaard as coach and end a run of two seasons without a trophy. To do so, he applied the same style of play that was used when he was a player at the Club, an attacking philosophy based on passing and it turned out to be a great success.
    
                    In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies available. After a winning start to the following campaign in 2009/10, Barça became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year of 2009. The run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles of a possible 19 as coach in his four seasons in charge. Guardiola became a reference point in football and his Barça side went beyond the strictly footballing field.</p>
    
                <b>BARÇA WIN THEIR THIRD CHAMPIONS LEAGUE</b>
    
                <p>FC Barcelona went to the Olympic Stadium looking to claim their third title of the season after having won the Copa del Rey and the league. Guardiola went into the final against Manchester United with several players missing in defence. The Premier League side started strongly but Eto’o’s goal changed the game and from then on Barça dominated with Messi adding a second to make the final score 2-0. On 27 May 2009 Barça claimed their third Champions League title thanks to victory over the holders, becoming the first Spanish side to claim the treble of the Copa del Rey, the league and the Champions League.</p>
    
                <b>2009, A MAGICAL YEAR</b>
    
                <p>Under the direction of Josep Guardiola, the team had a dream 12 months, winning every trophy possible. Six titles that they claimed with authority, Barça on the field were untouchable. At the end of the season there were celebrations and the trophies kept coming for the rest of the year.

                <h2 id="2ndTreble">2nd Treble 2014-2015</h2>
    
                <b>LUIS ENRIQUE: ARRIVAL AND A TREBLE</b><br>
    
                <p>Gerardo Martino took over for Tito Vilanova in the summer of 2013 but, despite a good start, the left after the 2013/14 season having only won the Spanish Super Cup. Luis Enrique, a beloved former Barça player, took Martino’s place as coach in the summer of 2014 and success immediately followed. In his first year as coach, Luis Enrique would attain the second treble in Barça history, just six seasons after the first. FC Barcelona won the League, Copa del Rey and Champions League in one magical season. The same team, consisting of top players like Messi, Iniesta, Neymar Jr and Luis Suárez went on to win a total of five titles in 2015, adding the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup to the treble. To that treble the team would add four more trophies the following season: the European Super Cup, the Club World Cup, the league and the Copa del Rey. Furthermore, in the 2016/17 season, the team won the Copa del Rey, their third in a row</p>
    
                <b>BARCELONA BREAK NEW GROUND WITH SECOND TREBLE</b><br>
    
                <p>FC Barcelona have completed the eighth 'treble' of European Cup plus domestic league and cup, becoming the first club to achieve the historic feat twice. FC Barcelona have wrapped up the eighth 'treble' of European Cup plus domestic league and cup and can pride themselves on being the first to achieve the feat twice after denying Juventus their own trio of trophies.
    
                Both clubs began the UEFA Champions League final inBerlin hoping to add to their league and cup wins in 2014/15, and it was Barcelona who eventually prevailed –repeating their achievement of 2008/09, when they became the only Spanish team to take all three titles. The Catalan giants have thus set a new benchmark, Luis Enrique's men having topped the Liga standings ahead of Real Madrid CF and lifted the Copa del Rey against Athletic Club last month. UEFA.com now looks at the seven previous sides to claim memorable trebles.</p>

                <h2 id="downfall">FCB Downfall</h2>
    
                <p><b>Mismanagement: </b>Bartomeu and his board have so much blood on their hands for misusing funds for all the wrong reasons.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Spent about £350 million on Dembele, Griezmann, Coutinho when actually only Dembele is probably a reasonable fit, yet too pricey.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sold players too late or too early just to fix the books but without any sporting project.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spent so much money on the new stadium while at least half the cost can be cut down and spent on scouting and preparing for tomorrow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p><b>Messi-dependency</b>Yes, it’s normal to depend on a player who happened to be GOAT and did a lot to you. But Barcelona went above and beyond on this. They literally looked spineless in a lot of games without him. The club still had world-class players like Suarez, Pique, Busquets, Coutinho, Griezmann, Ter Stegen, etc. The team acts like No Messi, No Party. The problem is with coaches who failed terribly in bringing the best out of them and making them work as a team.</p>
    
                <p><b>Academy in shambles</b> A once most glorified academy is almost useless and pretty much in shambles as of today. The club chose to make expensive and not-needed signings instead of picking players from the Masia and groom them a bit better to play the Barca game they’re used to. Players like Cucurella, Puig, Grimaldo, Alena, Traore, etc are misused and still being.</p>
    
                <p><b>Sporting Project</b> This echoes the first point again. The board pretty much is business-minded(or not even?) than working on building the team that could win the games and trophies. They took too long to sack Valverde who himself is a culprit in many ways and hired coaches with no plan whatsoever.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The series takes a fly-on-wall look at the last two years at the club seen from the perspective of the first team. The narrative begins when, still at the height of the pandemic, Barça suffered a resounding 2-8 defeat to Bayern Munich in Lisbon in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. It closes with the 2022/23 pre-season and the signing of new players, led by <b>Robert Lewandowski</b>.
    
                        And the fact is that on 14 August 2020, the end of an extraordinary era that began in 2004 was certified. That turning point at the club would culminate a few months later with the presidential elections won by Joan Laporta and his current Board of Directors, who opted for a new executive structure with Mateu Alemany and Jordi Cruyff at the helm, and, ultimately, there cruitment of <b>Xavi Hernández</b> as coach.</p>
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        <p>The series includes a look behind the scenes at such moments as Quique Setién's time in charge, Luis Suárez's departure, Leo Messi's estrangement from the previous board, the Argentinian's last season at the club, the arrival the Laporta, Messi's emotional farewell, the end of Ronald Koeman's era and how the signing of Xavi as Barça's new coach.
    
                        As the documentary series shows, the new manager was a crucial factor for getting the team back into contention in La Liga and <b>rebuilding the squad</b>, bringing in young, rising talent and making some key signings in the January 2022 winter market in the form of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ferran Torres, Dani Alves and Adama Traoré.</p>
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        The series ends with the <b>new injection of morale</b> when the club signed players of the calibre of Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde, Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie, Marcos Alonso, Héctor Bellerín and Pablo Torre, as well as Xavi's insistence that Ousmane Dembélé should stay.
    
                        President Joan Laporta and the club's economic recovery also feature prominently, including their part in the construction of a new-look Barça that has fostered renewed optimism among the fans and has ensured that the Spotify Camp Nou is once again filling to capacity.
